## An optimization model for designing efficient delivery routes

In this paper we address the territory design problem with the
purpose of vehicle routing. Given a road network, the goal is to create a given number of districts to optimize arc routing activities. The
territory design problem has applications in various fields such as delivery, political districting, and municipal services. An integer programming model that creates nodes 
in favor of forming Eulerian subgraphs is studied. The model can be used on tactical planning where demand, dispersion, distance, and parity are considered. 
Computational studies were performed to test the effect of parity constraints,number and location of depots, and balancing constraints on the objective function value.
Road networks comprised of up to 40 nodes, 68 edges, and 995 integer variables were solved successfully.
